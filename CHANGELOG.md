# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.2] - 2026-11-05

Documentation, metadata and analysis scripts. The only change to the platform is
the text of the privacy page.

### Added

- `experiments/duke_mst_cli/train_local_baseline.sh`, which trains the matched
  single-site and centralised baselines of the breast MRI worked example in the
  image and with the settings of the swarm runs.
- `experiments/duke_mst_cli/build_matched_baseline_report.py`, which compares the
  swarm runs with the matched baselines, and the single runs (FedProx, the run
  without node C, the web-interface run and the negative control) with the swarm
  runs, from per-case predictions.

### Changed

- `docs/reproduce.md` describes the matched baselines, the FedProx run and the
  new report, and that the Duke split files are published.
- `docs/os-support.md` states which operating systems have been tested.
- `docs/nvflare-comparison.md`: how the sandboxed site scripts read a site's data.
- `CITATION.cff`: version, release date, affiliations, abstract and message.

### Fixed

- The privacy page no longer claims differential privacy, secure aggregation or
  Byzantine-robust aggregation, gives TLS 1.2 or 1.3 for the web interface, and
  lists startup kits with their private keys among the stored data.
- `examples/breast_mri/README.md` matches the current scripts and uses made-up
  example rows.
- `examples/breast_mri/data_splits/README.md`: the Duke dataset DOI, licence
  (CC BY-NC 4.0) and citations, and the split counts.
